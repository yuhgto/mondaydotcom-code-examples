# monday.com Code Examples

This repo contains some examples for the monday apps framework and API. 

Each folder is an app, and most contain a README that goes deeper into how to set up and test the code example. You can clone the whole repo, or just get a specific one using `degit`:

```
npx degit github:yuhgto/mondaydotcom-code-examples/subdirectory
```

## Use this at your own risk!!! 
This is a repository of personal examples to demonstrate certain concepts in demos and articles. I do not actively maintain them ande they are certainly not intended for production use. 

Please check the last commit date for each folder to get a sense of how recently it was updated.
